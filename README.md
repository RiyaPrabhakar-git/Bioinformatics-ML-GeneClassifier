# Gene Expression Classifier (Machine Learning Mini-Project)

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to small gene expression datasets to classify samples as "Healthy" or "Disease".

## 🧬 Workflow
1. Load synthetic gene expression dataset  
2. Split into training and testing sets  
3. Standardize features  
4. Train a Random Forest classifier  
5. Evaluate model performance (accuracy + classification report)

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python  
- pandas  
- scikit-learn  
- Machine learning fundamentals  

## 📌 Learning Outcomes
- Feature scaling  
- Classification model building  
- Model evaluation  
- Bioinformatics-relevant ML workflow
